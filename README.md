## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Library Choices

**Why these libraries?**

- Libraries and tools were selected for their maturity, community support, and suitability for a modern React/TypeScript project. The stack prioritizes developer productivity, maintainability, and a great user experience. See inline 'Why' notes for each major choice below.

### Core Framework

**React 18 with TypeScript**

- **Why React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, large ecosystem, and excellent developer experience
- **Why TypeScript**: Provides static type checking, better IDE support, and catches errors at compile time
- **Why React 18**: Latest version with concurrent features, automatic batching, and improved performance

### Build Tools

**Create React App (CRA)**

- **Why CRA**: Zero-configuration setup, includes all necessary tools out of the box
- **Benefits**: Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and testing setup pre-configured
- **Trade-offs**: Less customization but faster development startup

### Testing Framework

**Jest + React Testing Library**

- **Why Jest**: Industry standard, excellent mocking capabilities, built-in coverage reporting
- **Why React Testing Library**: Promotes testing user behavior over implementation details
- **Philosophy**: "The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you"

### Code Quality Tools

**ESLint + Prettier**

- **Why ESLint**: Catches bugs, enforces code style, and maintains consistency across the codebase
- **Why Prettier**: Automatic code formatting eliminates style debates and ensures consistent formatting
- **Integration**: ESLint handles code quality, Prettier handles formatting

**Husky + lint-staged**

- **Why Husky**: Git hooks ensure code quality checks run before commits
- **Why lint-staged**: Only runs linters on staged files, improving performance
- **Result**: Prevents bad code from being committed

### Styling Approach

**CSS Modules + Custom CSS**

- **Why CSS Modules**: Provides local scoping, prevents style conflicts, and maintains component isolation
- **Why Custom CSS**: Full control over styling, no framework dependencies, smaller bundle size
- **Design System**: Custom CSS variables for consistent theming and maintainability

### State Management

**React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)**

- **Why Hooks**: Built into React, no external dependencies, excellent performance optimization
- **Why not Redux**: Application state is simple enough that Redux would be overkill
- **Why not Context API**: Component state is localized, no need for global state management

### API Integration

**Fetch API + Custom Service Layer**

- **Why Fetch API**: Built into browsers, no external dependencies, modern Promise-based API
- **Why Custom Service Layer**: Encapsulates API logic, provides error handling, and enables easy testing
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly error messages

### Component Architecture

**Generic + Feature-Specific Components**

- **Why Generic Components**: Reusable, testable, and maintainable UI building blocks
- **Why Feature Components**: Domain-specific logic and presentation
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to test, and scalable architecture

### Development Experience

**TypeScript Strict Mode**

- **Why Strict Mode**: Catches more potential errors, enforces better coding practices
- **Benefits**: Better IDE support, refactoring safety, and documentation through types

**Hot Reloading**

- **Why CRA's Hot Reloading**: Instant feedback during development, preserves component state
- **Benefits**: Faster development cycles and better debugging experience

### Performance Considerations

**Code Splitting**

- **Why**: Reduces initial bundle size and improves loading performance
- **Implementation**: React.lazy() for component-level code splitting

**Memoization**

- **Why useCallback/useMemo**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders and expensive calculations
- **Usage**: Applied to expensive operations and callback functions passed to child components

### Accessibility

**Semantic HTML + ARIA**

- **Why**: Ensures the application is usable by people with disabilities
- **Implementation**: Proper heading hierarchy, alt text, and keyboard navigation support

### Browser Support

**Modern Browsers**

- **Target**: ES2017+ browsers with full support for modern JavaScript features
- **Why**: Enables use of modern APIs without polyfills, smaller bundle size

### Alternative Technologies Considered

**Why not Next.js?**

- This is a client-side application, no server-side rendering needed
- CRA provides all necessary features for this use case

**Why not Styled Components?**

- CSS Modules provide similar benefits with better performance
- No runtime CSS-in-JS overhead

**Why not Material-UI/Ant Design?**

- Custom design system provides better brand consistency
- Smaller bundle size and full design control

**Why not GraphQL?**

- REST API is sufficient for this use case
- Simpler implementation and debugging

## üîÆ Future Improvements & Limitations

**What was skipped or simplified and why?**

- To deliver a robust MVP quickly, some advanced features and optimizations were left for future work. These include E2E testing, advanced analytics, OAuth, Dockerization, and CI/CD. The current implementation focuses on core functionality, code quality, and test coverage. See the list below for specifics.

- Bookmarking and notifications

**Testing & Quality**

- End-to-end testing (Cypress/Playwright)
- Performance testing with Lighthouse CI
- Automated accessibility testing
- Visual regression testing

**DevOps & Monitoring**

## üìû Support

If you have any questions or need help:

1. Check the documentation
2. Search existing issues
3. Create a new issue with detailed information

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

- **Dynamic import mocking fails in Jest**: If you encounter issues mocking dynamic imports (e.g., in `reportWebVitals`), consider removing or simplifying the test. Focus on testing function signatures and error handling instead of mocking the import directly.
- **localStorage not persisting in tests**: Ensure your localStorage mock resets state between tests. Use a fresh mock implementation in each test suite.
- **Prettier/ESLint errors**: Run `npm run lint -- --fix` or `npm run format` to auto-fix most issues.
- **TypeScript errors with null/any**: Use `unknown as Type` instead of `any` to satisfy strict type checks.

If you encounter other issues, check the documentation, search existing issues, or open a new issue for help.

**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies**

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project Philosophy & Decisions

- **Why these libraries?**
  - Chosen for reliability, ecosystem support, and developer experience. React and TypeScript provide a robust, type-safe foundation. Create React App (CRA) offers a fast, zero-config setup. Jest and React Testing Library enable user-focused, maintainable tests. ESLint and Prettier ensure code quality and consistency. CSS Modules allow for modular, conflict-free styling.
- **What was skipped or simplified?**
  - Some advanced features (e.g., E2E testing, OAuth, analytics, virtual scrolling for huge lists, Docker, CI/CD) were omitted or stubbed due to time constraints. The focus was on a clean, maintainable, and well-tested core experience. See details below for future improvements and limitations.
